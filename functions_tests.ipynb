However, the impact could be further enhanced by ensuring broader community involvement in the survey and subsequent initiatives to deepen buy-in and strengthen the sustainability of the behaviors being promoted.\\n\\n3. **Long-Term Impact**: The focus on sustainability and long-term changes in behavior is commendable. The initiative addresses not only immediate energy behaviors but also aims for a cultural shift toward pro-environmental attitudes over time. While the long-term vision is compelling, the actual effectiveness in achieving these changes is yet to be validated and may require continual monitoring and adjustments based on gathered data.\\n\\n4. **Diagnostics and Challenges**: The emphasis on diagnosing misconceptions indicates a thoughtful approach to understanding community dynamics. Nevertheless, challenges related to cognitive biases and the initial resistance to change may hinder progress unless strategically managed. Further interventions may also need to be considered beyond the survey to ensure sustained engagement.\\n\\nIn summary, while the proposed social innovation has the elements of a strong impact through economic benefits, community focus, and long-term goals, its current potential could be seen as satisfactory but needing improvement in areas like community engagement and adaptive strategies to address unforeseen challenges. Allocating resources towards these improvements can elevate the overall effectiveness of the initiative and its intended outcomes.',\n",
